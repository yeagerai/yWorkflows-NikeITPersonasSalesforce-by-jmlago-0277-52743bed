# Nike IT Personas Salesforce Component

## Component Name
NikeITPersonasSalesforce

## Description
This component is designed to process a list of URLs, extract employee names and emails, and save them into the Salesforce API. It is part of a Yeager Workflow to perform data processing tasks to support Nike IT Personas.

## Input and Output Models
The component uses two Pydantic models to define and validate the input and output data:

1. `NikeITPersonasInput`: Contains a list of URLs as input data.
2. `NikeITPersonasOutput`: Contains the extracted employee data as a list of dictionaries, and the Salesforce API response.

### NikeITPersonasInput
- `urls`: List[str] - A list of URLs to be processed.

### NikeITPersonasOutput
- `employee_data`: List[Dict[str, str]] - A list of dictionaries with extracted employee names and emails.
- `salesforce_response`: Dict[str, typing.Any] - A dictionary containing the Salesforce API response.

## Parameters
- `args`: NikeITPersonasInput - Required input data supplied as an instance of the NikeITPersonasInput class.
- `callbacks`: typing.Any - Optional; passed to the superclass's transform method.

## Transform Function
The transform() method is implemented as an asynchronous function, which performs the following steps:

1. Call the superclass's transform method with the input arguments and callbacks.
2. Extract the employee names and emails from the processed data. (Actual implementation missing in provided code)
3. Save the extracted employee data into the Salesforce API. (Actual implementation missing in provided code)
4. Return an instance of the NikeITPersonasOutput class with the extracted employee data and the Salesforce API response.

## External Dependencies
- typing: For advanced type hinting.
- dotenv: For loading environment variables.
- fastapi: For creating and defining the FastAPI instance and its endpoints.
- pydantic: For creating, validating, and serializing the input and output data models.

## API Calls
The component is expected to make calls to the Salesforce API within the transform() method to save the employee data. However, the provided code does not include the actual implementation details.

## Error Handling
The component does not have any specific error handling or exception handling mechanisms. However, any errors encountered within the transform() method will be propagated to the calling context.

## Examples
To use the NikeITPersonasSalesforce component within a Yeager Workflow:

1. Create an instance of the NikeITPersonasInput class with the required input URLs.
